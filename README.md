# sefactory-clone-frontend

I have worked on this assignment before Ahmad's lecture and now I dont want to fix its responsiveness because my way of building the website and class's names are a mess, but I have learned alot from Ahmad today so hopefully I will implement them in the future assignments/projects. 

PS: okay i lied, I cant give up on something i havent finished, yet it isnt perfect because my intial way of starting was bad practice, i did my best with what I had after Ahmad's lecture.
